# EJ2-Synfusion
Over the past weeks, I have been working on an Angular project where I designed a website using the Syncfusion EJ2 components. This project involved extensive use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside JSON and the Angular framework.

Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience and learned several key aspects of Angular, including:

Routing: Implementing efficient navigation within the application..
Local Hosting: Setting up and managing the project on a local server for development purposes.
Command Line: Utilizing various commands in the terminal using Visual Studio Code for efficient project management and development.
Node Modules: Understanding and managing Node modules in Angular projects.
File Handling: Working with .ts (TypeScript) and .html files.
Bootstrap: Implementing responsive design using Bootstrap.
